  untrusted HTML.

  [timo]


1.0b11 (2010-11-03)
-------------------

- Fix Dutch and Czech language code and name.
  [timo]

  but no other validation package is installed.
  [naro]

  name, not full name"

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11157.
  [timo]

  The BulkActionsView expects the absolute path of the comments without the
  portal url (e.g. '/plone/doc1/++conversation++default/1285346769126020').
  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11156.
  [timo]

  "$(document).ready(function(){ /* some code that uses $ \*/ });" to invoke

  [timo]
