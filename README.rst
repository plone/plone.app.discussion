Introduction
============


plone.app.discussion replaces the old commenting system in Plone 4.1 and is also
available as an add-on product for Plone 3 and 4. It was initially developed as
part of the Google Summer of Code 2009 by Timo Stollenwerk (student) and Martin
Aspeli (mentor).

.. note::

  Make sure you pin down plone.app.discussion to versions < 2.0 if you want to
  install it as an add-on product (see install instructions below for more
  details).
