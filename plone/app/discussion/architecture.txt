Architectural Principles
========================

This document outlines architectural principles used in the design of
plone.app.discussion.

  **Discussion items have a portal_type**
    This makes it easier to search for them and manage them using existing
    CMF and Plone UI constructs.

  **Discussion items are cataloged**
    It is possible to search for discussion items like any other type of
    content.

  **Discussion items are subject to workflow and permission**
    Moderation, anonymous commenting, and auto approve/reject should be
    handled using workflow states, automatic and manual transitions, and
    permissions.

  **Discussion items are light weight objects**
    Discussion item objects are as light weight as possible. Ideally, a
    discussion item should be as lightweight as a catalog brain. This may mean
    that we forego convenience base classes and re-implement certain interfaces.
    Comments should not provide the full set of dublin core metadata, though
    custom indexers can be used to provide values for standard catalog indexes.

  **Optimise for retrival speed**
    HTML filtering and other processing should happen on save, not on render,
    to make rendering quick.

  **Settings are stored using plone.registry**
    Any global setting should be stored in plone.registry records.

  **Forms are constructed using extensible z3c.form forms**
    This allows plugins (such as spam protection algorithms) to provide
    additional validation. It also allows integrators to write add-ons that add
    new fields to the comment form.

  **Discussion items are stored in a BTree container**
    This allows faster lookup and manipulation.

  **Discussion items are accessed using a dict-like interface**
    This makes iteration and manipulation more natural. Even if comments are
    not stored threaded, the dict interface should act as if they are, i.e.
    calling items() on a comment should return the replies to that comment
    (in order).

  **Discussion items are retrieved in reverse creation date order**
    Discussion items do not need to support explicit ordering. They should
    always be retrieved in reverse creation date order (most recent for).
    They can be stored with keys so that this is always true.

  **Discussion items do not need readable ids**
    Ids can be based on the creation date.

  **Discussion items send events**
    The usual zope.lifecycleevent and zope.container events are fired when
    discussion items are added, removed, or modified.
